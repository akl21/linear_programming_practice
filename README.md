# linear_programming_practice
In this repository, practice code is stored for a research project on optimizing solar power for the electrical grid. There are different possible objectives, but a current goal is to minimize the difference between energy needed and energy produced by photovoltaic systems (including the battery) over time. 

To solve the objectives, optimization models are built in Python using Gurobi optimization software. Currently, the models are limited to linear programming problems, but other mathematical programming models such as mixed integer linear programming models can be implemented with Gurobi.
